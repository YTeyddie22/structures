HASH SETS
A hash code is a unique key generated to determine which bucket an element belongs to

Buckets are containers that store the elements to be accessed

A hash set has a constant time of O(1) unlike the arrays which have O(n) but in the worst case hash sets have a time complexity of o(n)
This is when the element to be accessed is the last element in the set

To use sets, Python has it's own set data type to assist with the implementation
